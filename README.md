# spDB -  an extremely memory-efficient vector database

Existing open source vector databases are built on HNSW indexes that must be held entirely in memory to be used. This uses an extremely large amount of memory, which severely limits the sizes of vector DBs that can be used locally, and creates very high costs for cloud deployments.

Itâ€™s possible to build a vector database with extremely low memory requirements that still has high recall and low latency. The key is to use a highly compressed search index, combined with reranking from disk, as demonstrated in the [Zoom](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.04067) paper.
